    "This assignment is split in three parts:\n",
    " 1. In the first part, we will analyze a large data set with UNIX tools.\n",
    " 2. Next, we will see how the analysis we did would be done in SQL.\n",
    " 3. Lastly, we included a refresher on more advanced SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen in the lecture, **UNIX tools** are a handy way to quickly get some insights into data sets. They are **available on almost all systems and don't require any setup**, which is a huge advantage if you think about it! I still use the Unix tools we discussed almost every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, they will only get you so far. That's the reason why we will also look into other, **more practical and specialized** ways to analyze large data sets after the first half of the assignment. For **relational datasets**, like the one we have here, you would use some sort of database. **DuckDB** is especially suitable here because it is a very modern implementation and allows you to run queries directly on raw files without needing to import them into the database. This makes it very handy for this task. You will quickly realize how different and probably more straight-forward it will be. You can use the results from the second part to cross-check with your results from the first-part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we will give you some tasks that require the use of more involved SQL features. This should serve as a refresher for you. If you never touched SQL, it might be a bit trickier, but surely not impossible! You can always reach out for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Structure\n",
    "We will use Jupyter notebooks throughout most of the exercises. The reason for this is that this tool is oftentimes used in the data science / data engineering space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, particularly in this assignment, we will use bash commands that we run from this notebook. We do this by marking the whole cell for executing with bash via the `%%bash` magic at the beginning. An alternative is to use `%bash` in front of a single line or use `!` followed by the command.\n",
    "The same applies for SQL code. In this code, we will use the so-called sql \"line magic\", that is, after setting up the proper config, you can run SQL in DuckDB by just starting a line with `%sql` followed by the SQL string. If you want to write multi-line SQL, you can end a line with `\\`, which means that the line will be concatenated with the following line. Be careful with comments if you are using the trick with `\\`!\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Python packages are required for this assignment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pandas\n",
    "pyarrow\n",
    "duckdb\n",
    "jupysql\n",
    "duckdb-engine\n",
    "matplotlib\n",
    "pillow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset\n",
    "We will use a data set that contains taxi drives from New York, which is provided for free by the city of New York. Interestingly, this data set is used in many research works because it (a) is easy to work with (b) contains real-life data and (c) has a decent size. For this exercise, we will only use the data from August 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation of this data set is available at <https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page>. Specifically, have a look at <https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf>.\n",
    "When you look on the website, you will see several mentions of the \"Parquet format\". We will not use this for now, but we will learn about it later in the course. For now, we will first convert it to CSV, so that you can manually inspect the file.\n"

Data sets might be \"top-heavy\", i.e. a significant portion of data points are concentrated towards the higher end of the scale, or \"bottom-heavy\", which is just the opposite of top-heavy. When it comes to heavily skewed data distributions, it's important to understand that single metrics like a MEAN don't fully describe the \"average characteristics\". A property of top-heavy data sets is that the MEAN is larger than the MEDIAN because there are some large values that pull up the MEDIAN. As we will see in a minute, `passenger_count` is a bottom-heavy distribution.\n",
